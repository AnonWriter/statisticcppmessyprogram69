# statisticcppmessyprogram69
This was born as a small program for one small homework in my statistics class that I want to share to my friends. Also testing github repositories.

You have to compile it yourself of course. I used the g++/gnu compiler that comes with code;;blocks.
Or you can download the .exe, but that thing needs the compiler too for the stdlib.h library.
